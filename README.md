## Prerequisites
1. [node](www.nodejs.org) & [npm](www.nodejs.org)

## Getting Started
Don't run `npm i[nstall]`, all you have to do is start the server with

`npm run server`

### Important notes
Eventually we will add a watch-less for using less and having it compile and building during development
Do your development in the assets directory and let babel build
and compile source to the build directory

Right now we are using [livereload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) for reloading browser during development construction install and working in chrome
