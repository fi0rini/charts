            <h2>Simplified <small>Technology</small></h2>
            <p>
                Your data lives in the cloud so never invest in servers or IT support when you don't have to. The software is usable from laptops, smartphones, and tablets because all you need is a web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point you might be wondering how you could trust patient data to live in the cloud. Which is why you should know that our servers are secure, encapsulted, encrypted, and monitored 24/7. We use advanced state-of-the-art algorithms to protect your patients identities and take all security risks out of your hands. Let our data experts, and security analysts do their jobs so your crews can focus on patient care.
            </p>
